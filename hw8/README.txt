Hey Adam,

I have a few different versions because I couldn't get this to work on my local mavericks computer so I was runnning everything on the linux based neuroscience cluster and then just pulling the script over and saving it to my repo, so I wanted to keep a few different versions. Anyways, the ImageGUI_final.py should run fine, assuming you are not on mavericks. You can Frame the picture, you can Brighten it, you can Mirror it, you can Sharpen it, you can boost the contrast, and you can rotate it. I also made a dropdown menu so that you can change how much you rotate the image. Also, I made a save function, as it makes sense that one would actually want to save out these images. I actually might use the GUI for MRI brain images, but have it search directories for subjects or whatever. You can also reset the image by pressing the search button again('Search or Reset Image!' button, actually)

Also, I had the tryagain.jpg image because I wanted to handle errors well, but it seems that Josh and I fixed that problem, but I kept it in the repo and script just incase. 

My favorite searches are "darwin badass" and "Adam Blake Anders"
