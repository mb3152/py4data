Hey Adam, 

Part 1 is in notebook for only as "sever" and "client". Just run through the notebook for the server, then for the client. I have the image I used in there, but I have a user imput option so you can easily put in the images you want. It takes around 2 minutes for all 3 image anipulations to run and everything. They should pop up when it's done. 

Part 2 has the example with the plots in the notebook Audio_Example. They I have a .py file called Audio_Real that loops through all the images and says which notes are found. 

Thanks! 
Maxwell
