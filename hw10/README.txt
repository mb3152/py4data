Hey Adam,


Run webbib.py and it will tell where it is hosted on the command line. For me it is http://127.0.0.1:5000/

You should be taken to a screen that asks you to upload your bibtex file and name it. Don't put any spaces or funny characters in the name.

Next, it should take you to a query page. You can do SQL queries. It should take you to another page after this that is the results, and then you have the option to add another bibtex file, or do another query. 

I put screenshots in for what it should look like. Let me know if you can't recreate that! 

Also, you need all the folders and what not that are in this hw10/ directory. you should have a templates, static, and uploads directory, as well as the schema.sql file. You should probably remove the bibtex.db file though and start fresh!  

I only tested it with the bibtex file you guys gave us. Hope that is okay. 

I only used Keywords, Journal, Year, Title, and Author, as the other options had too many missing values.
I tested all the queries and they should work fine, especially if you use the fuzzy query way.

Cheers,
Maxwell
